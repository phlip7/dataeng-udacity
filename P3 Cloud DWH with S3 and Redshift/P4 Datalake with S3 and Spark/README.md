Project 4: Datalake. 

Project Description :  

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake.   
Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The repo contains an an ETL pipeline that  
- extracts their data from S3,  
- processes them using Spark,  
- and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables.
