### Project 3: Song Play Analysis With S3 and Redshift

##### Project Description :  
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database   
and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3,   
in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory  
with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.  
  
The repo contains an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift,  
and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables
